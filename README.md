## Controlling a Robot with EMG Sensors and Arduino 
This project was conducted for the bachelor's degree under the supervision of [Dr.Mehdi Baradarannia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zclZQhcAAAAJ) at the [University of Tabriz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tabriz).

## Description

This project allows you to control a robot using EMG [Electromyography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography) sensors and Arduino. It also includes a remote control functionality using Bluetooth modules. The system interprets muscle signals captured by the EMG sensors and translates them into commands for the robot, enabling intuitive control based on muscle movements.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Connect the Arduino board to your computer.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and load the Arduino sketch provided in the repository.
4. Install the required libraries through the Arduino Library Manager.
5. Connect the EMG sensors to the Arduino board as per the provided documentation.
6. Connect the Bluetooth modules and set up the communication between the remote control device and the Arduino board.
7. Compile and upload the sketch to the Arduino board.
8. Power up the robot and ensure that all the connections are secure.

## Usage

1. Turn on the EMG sensors and ensure they are properly positioned on the user's muscles.
2. Establish a Bluetooth connection between the remote control device and the Arduino board.
3. [Calibrate](#sensor-calibration) the system, adjusting the sensitivity and thresholds as needed.
4. The EMG signals will be continuously monitored and translated into control commands for the robot.
5. Use the remote control device to send commands via Bluetooth, allowing manual control of the robot.
6. Explore the possibilities of controlling the robot through muscle movements and the remote control interface.
